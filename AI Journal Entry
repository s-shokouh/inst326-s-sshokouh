Week 1
This week I used AI to help me understand some Python concepts. I asked it to explain loops, variables, and how to fix small mistakes in my code. It gave me clear examples that made things easier to understand.

I also used AI to help brainstorm ideas for my class project and to reword some of my notes so they were easier to read.

Here are some of my AI chat links:

I learned that AI can give quick examples and explanations, I tried to wrote my own code and i got help from AI.

WEEK 2 
This week I used AI for some of my Python questions, and it helped me understand them better. However, I think I still need to practice more to improve my Python coding skills.

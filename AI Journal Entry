Week 1
This week I used AI to help me understand some Python concepts. I asked it to explain loops, variables, and how to fix small mistakes in my code. It gave me clear examples that made things easier to understand.

I also used AI to help brainstorm ideas for my class project and to reword some of my notes so they were easier to read.

Here are some of my AI chat links:

I learned that AI can give quick examples and explanations, I tried to wrote my own code and i got help from AI.

WEEK 2 
This week I used AI for some of my Python questions, and it helped me understand them better. However, I think I still need to practice more to improve my Python coding skills.

WEEK 3 
This week, I used AI to summarize my SQL book chapter and give me a short summary for better understanding. I also got some help with my Python homework because I still need more practice, as I have a lot of issues with writing Python code.

WEEK 4
This week I was actually really sick, so I didnâ€™t use AI that much. But, I did use AI to help me understand some philosophy concepts that I struggled with in class, and I also used it to complete some of my Python homework.
